              My name is <b>Jennifer</b> and I am a woman who likes to program. Although my skills are not perfect, I am learning to improve my skills everytime I build something new. Please check out my LinkedIn and Github! It will tell you more about my technical abilities and applications.
            <br>
              Things that are not mentioned in my professional profiles are I am a doggie mommy! I have two dogs named Baby (14YO) and Shledon (8YO). I celebrated my first Mother's day with them this year, I could't have asked for a better Mother's day gift than being with my two munchkins! In addition, I like to cook Vietnamese food and quilt, I know - I sound mature for my age. But I genuinely enjoy projects that take a lot of care and time to accomplish. I take pride in my work and when my work is done, because I know I gave it my all. So, long story short is, I recently learned how to qulit, not quit! 
            <br>
              I hope you enjoyed these fun facts. Please checkout my Github, I constantly update it and see you next time!
            <br> <br>
            Tạm biệt,
            <br>
