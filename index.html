            My name is <b>Jennifer</b> and I am a woman who likes to program. Although my skills are not perfect, I am learning to improve my skills every time I build something new. Please check out my LinkedIn and Github! It will tell you more about my technical abilities and applications I have built.
            <br>
              Things that are not mentioned in my professional profiles are I am a doggie mommy! I have two dogs named Baby (14YO) and Sheldon (8YO). I celebrated my first Mother's day with them this year, I couldn't have asked for a better Mother's day gift than being with my two munchkins! In addition, I like to bike, cook Vietnamese food, and quilting! 
              
            <br>
              <u>Fun fact</u>: At one point in my life, I would bike at least 75miles a week for months! It gave me great physical exercise and mental clarity.
            <br>
              Then after biking, I would be famished, so I learned how to cook Vietnamese food a few years back. Most of my recipes are my mother's but IMO she makes the <u>BEST</u> Vietnamese food.

              Making a quilt isn',t easy but it is rewarding and it can keep you warm on chilly nights. Plus, they can be used to add personality to any room. Quilting is fun and I recommend you try it.

              I genuinely enjoy the goals and projects that require care and time to accomplish. I take pride in my work and when my work is complete, I am usually proud because I know I gave it all I could. From all of my efforts, I learned how to stay on track to reach my goal; to stay hungry; and to quilt, not quit! 
            <br>
              I hope you enjoyed these fun facts. Please check out my Github, I constantly update it and see you next time!
            <br> <br>
            Tạm biệt,
            <br>
